## About me
<p>If you're reading this, that means I'm about to complete my exciting career switch from Education to Data Analytics, which I accomplished in just 1 year. And now I’m looking for a place where I can apply my freshly acquired data skills.</p>

<p>My transition became possible because of my outstanding personal skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>🧑‍🎓 I'm a great learner. And if I don't know how to achieve something then I can gain this knowledge easily. I can stay focused for a long time, set reasonable deadlines and follow them.</p></li>
<li><p>👯 I’m a great peer. I used to be a teacher and the best thing I can do is to explain complicated things in simple terms.</p></li>
<li><p>🤔 I have strong Logical and Analytical skills, which is proven by the ALVA Logic Test (my score is 9 out of 10 or TOP 93rd-98th percentile).</p></li>
<li><p>🧩 I am crazy about quests, quizzes and brainteasers. And I don't give up until I solve one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I'm eager to make this world more data-driven. Are you with me?</p>
